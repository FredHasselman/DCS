Complexity research transcends the boundaries the classical scientific disciplines in terms of explanatory goals (e.g. causal-mechanistic) and is a hot topic in physics, mathematics, biology, economy and psychology. The main focus in the cognitive behavioural sciences is a description and explanation of behaviour based on interaction dominant dynamics: Many processes interact on many different (temporal and spatial) scales and observable behaviour emerges out of those interactions through a process of self-organization or soft-assembly. Contrary to what the term might suggest, complexity research is often about finding simple models that are able to simulate a wide range of complex behaviour. This approach differs fundamentally from the more classical approaches where behaviour is caused by a system of many hidden (cognitive) components which interact in sequence as in a machine (component dominant dynamics). The most important difference is how ‘change’, and hence the time-evolution of a system, is studied. The main focus of the course will be ‘hands-on’ data-analysis in R, or, in Matlab if student is already familiar with the scritping language. Topics include: Analysis of fractal geometry (i.e. pink noise) in time series (Standardized Dispersion Analysis, Power Spectral Density Analysis, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis); Nonlinear and chaotic time series analysis (Phase Space Reconstruction, (Cross) Recurrence Quantification Analysis, Entropy Estimation); Growth Curve models; Potential Theory; and Catastrophe Theory (Cusp model), Complex Network Analysis.

["learning-objectives.html", "1.1 Learning objectives", " 1.1 Learning objectives Students who followed this course will be able to critically evaluate whether their scientific inquiries can benefit from adopting theories, models, methods and analyses that were developed to study the dynamics of complex systems. The student will be able to understand in more detail the basics of formal theory evaluation, and be able to recognize, interpret and deduce theoretical accounts of human behaviour that are based on component-dominant versus interaction-dominant ontology. Students will be able to use the basic mathematical models and analyses that allow study of complex interaction-dominant behaviour. Students who finish the course will be able to conduct analyses in Excel, SPSS, and R or Matlab and interpret the results from basic (non-)linear time series methods. At the end of this course, students have reached a level of understanding that allows them to find relevant scientific sources and understand and follow up on new developments in the complex systems approach to behavioural science. Goals Summary Read and understand papers that use a complex systems approach to study human behaviour. Simulate the basic dynamical models. Perform the basic analyses. "],

["the-linear-map.html", "2.1 The Linear Map", " 2.1 The Linear Map Equation (2.1) is the ordinary difference equation (ODE) discussed in the lecture (see lecture notes ??) is called the Linear Map: \\[\\begin{equation} Y_{t+1} = Y_{t=0} + r*Y_t \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] In these excersises you will simulate time series produced by the change process in equation @(eq:linmap) for different parameter settings of the growth-rate parameter \\(r\\) (the control parameter) and the initial conditions \\(Y_0\\). This is different from a statistical analysis in which parameters are estimated from a data set. The goal of the assignments is to get a feeling for what a dynamical model is, and how it is different from a linear statistical regression model like GLM. 2.1.1 The Linear Map in a Spreadsheet Before you begin, be sure to check the following settings: Open a Microsoft Excel worksheet, a Google sheet, or other spreadsheet. Check whether the spreadsheet uses a ‘decimal-comma’ (\\(0,05\\)) or ‘decimal-point’ (\\(0.05\\)) notation. The numbers given in the assignments of this course all use a ‘decimal-point’ notation. Check if the $ symbol fixes rows and columns when it used in a formula in your preferred spreadsheet program. This is the default setting in Microsoft Excel and Google. If you use one of those programs you are all set, otherwise you will have to replace the $ used in the assignments with the one used by your software. Type r in cell A5. This is the control parameter. It receives the value \\(1.08\\) in cellB5. Type \\(Y_0\\) in cell A6. This is the initial value. It receives the value \\(0.1\\) in cell B6. Use the output level (\\(Y_t\\)) of every step as the input to calculate the next level (\\(Y_{t+1}\\)). Rows in the spreadsheet will represent the values of the process at different moments in time. Put the initial value (\\(Y_0\\)) in cell A10. This cell marks time \\(t=0\\). To get it right, type: =$B$6. The = means that (in principle) there is a ‘calculation’ going on (a function is applied). The $ determines that column ($B) as well as the row ($6) keep the same value (i.e., constant) for each time step. Enter the Linear Map as a function in each cell. Type =$B$5*A10 in cell A11. This means that the value of cell A11 (i.e. \\(Y_{t=1}\\)) will be calculated by multiplying the value of cell B5 (parameter r) with the value of cell A10 (previous value, here: \\(Y_{t=0}\\)). If everything is all right, cell A11 now shows the value \\(0.108\\). Repeat this step for cell A12. Remember what it is you are doing! You are calculating \\(Y_{t=2}\\) now (i.e. the next step), which is determined by \\(Y_{t=1}\\) (i.e., the previous step) and the parameter r. Now repeat this simple iterative step for 100 further steps. Instead of typing everything over and over again, copy-paste the whole thing.Most spreadsheet programs will automatically adjust the formula by advancing each row or column number that aren’t fixed by $. Copy cell A12 all the way from A13 to A110 (keep the SHIFT button pressed to select all cells). You have just simulated a time series based on a theoretical change process! 2.1.2 Visualizing the time series Select cells A10 to A110 Create a line graph (Insert, 2D-line, Scatter). This will show you the graph. (There are other ways to do this, by the way, which work just as well.) You can play with the setting to make the best suitable view, like rescaling the axes. If you change the values in cells B5 and B6 you will see an immediate change in the graph. To study model behaviour, try the following growth parameters: \\(a = -1.08\\) \\(a = 1,08\\) \\(a = 1\\) \\(a = -1\\) Change the initial value \\(Y_0\\) in cell B6 to \\(10\\).

The parameters are the same as for the Linear Map, there has to be an initial value \\(Y_{t=0}\\) (no longer explicit as a constant in equation (2.2)) and the control parameter \\(r\\).

["conditional-growth-jumps-and-stages.html", "3.2 Conditional growth: Jumps and Stages", " 3.2 Conditional growth: Jumps and Stages Auto-conditional jumps Suppose we want to model that the growth rate \\(r\\) increases after a certain amount has been learned. In general, this is a very common phenomenon, for instance: when becoming proficient at a skill, growth (in proficiency) is at first slow, but then all of a sudden there can be a jump to the appropriate (and sustained) level of proficiency. Take the model you just built as a starting point with \\(r = 0.1\\) (B5) Type \\(0.5\\) in C5. This will be the new parameter value for \\(r\\). Build your new model in column B (leave the original in A). Suppose we want our parameter to change when a growth level of \\(0.2\\) is reached. We???ll need an IF statement which looks something like this: IF \\(L &gt; 0.2\\) then use the parameter value in C5, otherwise use the parameter value in B5. Excel has a built in IF function (may be ALS in Dutch). In the first cell in which calculations should start, press \\(=\\) and then from the formula list choose the IF function, or just type it. Try to figure out what you have to do. In the Logical_test box you should state something which expresses \\(L &gt; 0.2\\). The other fields tell Excel what to do when this statement is TRUE (then use parameter value in C5) or when it is FALSE (then use paramter value in B5). Note: the word value might be misleading; you can also input new statements. Make a graph in which the old and the new conditional models are represented by lines. Try changing the value of \\(r\\) in C5 into: \\(1, 2, 2.8, 2.9, 3\\). Auto-conditional stages Another conditional change we might want to explore is that when a certain growth level is reached the carrying capacity K increases, reflecting that new resources have become available to support further growth. Now we want \\(K\\) to change, so type \\(1\\) in B7, \\(2\\) in C7. Build your model in column C. Follow the same steps as above, but now make sure that when \\(L &gt; 0.99\\), \\(K\\) changes to the value in C7. Keep \\(r = 0.2\\) (B5). If all goes well you should see two stages when you create a graph of the timeseries in column C. Change \\(K\\) in C7 to other values. Try to also change the growth rate r after reaching \\(L &gt; 0.99\\) by referring to C5. Start with a value of \\(0.3\\) in C5. Set \\(K\\) in C7 to \\(2\\) again.

Simulation requires a numerical method to ‘solve’ this differential equation for time, which means we need a method to approach, or estimate continuous time in discrete time. Below you will receive a speed course in one of the simplest numerical procedures for integrating differential equations, the Euler method. 3.4.1 Euler Method A general differential equation is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x) \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] Read it as saying: “a change in \\(x\\) over a change in time is a function of \\(x\\) itself”. This can be approximated by considering the change to be over some constant, small time step \\(\\Delta\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{(x_{t+1} = x_t)}{\\Delta} = f(x_t) \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] After rearranging the terms a more familiar form reveals itself: \\[\\begin{align} x_{t+1} &amp;= x_t &amp;= f(x_t) * \\Delta \\\\ x_{t+1} &amp;= f(x_t) * \\Delta + x_t \\tag{3.5} \\end{align}\\] This looks like an ordinary iterative process, \\(\\Delta\\) the time constant determines the size of time step taken at every successive iteration.

Start with \\(a = d = 1\\) and \\(b = c = 2\\) and the initial conditions \\(R_0 = 0.1\\) and \\(F_0 = 0.1\\). Use a time constant of \\(0.01\\) and make at least \\(1000\\) iterations. Visualize the dynamics of the system by plotting: \\(F\\) against \\(R\\) (i.e., the state space) \\(R\\) and \\(F\\) against time (i.e., the timeseries) in one plot. Starting from the initial predator and prey population represented by the point \\((R, F) = (0.1, 0.1)\\), how do the populations evolve over time? Try to get a grip on the role of the time constant by increasing and decreasing it slightly (e.g. \\(\\Delta = 0.015\\)) for fixed parameter values. (You might have to add some more iterations to complete the plot). What happens to the plot? Hint: Remember that \\(\\Delta\\) is not a fundamental part of the dynamics, but that it is only introduced by the numerical integration (i.e., the approximation) of the differential equation. It should not change the dynamics of the system, but it has an effect nonetheless. | jump to solution | "],

Create a line graph of \\(Y(t)\\), plot the predicted values of the nonlinear regression and the unstandardized predicted values of the linear polynomial regression against time in one figure. Now you can see that the shape is approximated by the polynomials, but it is not quite the same. Is this really a model of a growth process as we could encounter it in nature? | jump to solution | 4.1.2 Correlation functions and AR-MA models Download the file series.sav from blackboard. It contains three time series TS_1, TS_2 and TS_3. As a first step look at the mean and the standard deviation (Analyze &gt;&gt; Descriptives). Suppose these were time series from three subjects in an experiment, what would you conclude based on the means and SD’s? Let’s visualize these data. Go to Forecasting &gt;&gt; Time Series &gt;&gt; Sequence Charts. Check the box One chart per variable and move all the variables to Variables. Are they really the same? Let’s look at the ACF and PCF Go to Analyze &gt;&gt; Forecasting &gt;&gt; Autocorrelations. Enter all the variables and make sure both Autocorrelations (ACF) and Partial autocorrelations (PACF) boxes are checked. Click Options, and change the Maximum Number of Lags to 30. Use the table to characterize the time series: SHAPE INDICATED MODEL Exponential, decaying to zero Autoregressive model. Use the partial autocorrelation plot to identify the order of the autoregressive model Alternating positive and negative, decaying to zero Autoregressive model. Use the partial autocorrelation plot to help identify the order. One or more spikes, rest are essentially zero Moving average model, order identified by where plot becomes zero. Decay, starting after a few lags Mixed autoregressive and moving average model. All zero or close to zero Data is essentially random. High values at fixed intervals Include seasonal autoregressive term. No decay to zero Series is not stationary. You should have identified just one time series with autocorrelations: TS_2. Try to fit an ARIMA(p,0,q) model on this time series. Go to Analyze &gt;&gt; Forecasting &gt;&gt; Create Model, and at Method (Expert modeler) choose ARIMA. Look back at the PACF to identify which order (p) you need (last lag value at which the correlation is still significant). This lag value should go in the Autocorrelation p box. Start with a Moving Average q of one. The time series variable TS_2 is the Dependent. You can check the statistical significance of the parameters in the output under Statistics, by checking the box Parameter Estimates. This value for p is probably too high, because not all AR parameters are significant. Run ARIMA again and decrease the number of AR parameters by leaving out the non-significant ones. By default SPSS saves the predicted values and 95% confidence limits (check the data file). We can now check how well the prediction is: Go to Graphs &gt;&gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt;&gt; Line. Select Multiple and Summaries of Separate Variables. Now enter TS_2, Fit_X, LCL_X and UCL_X in Lines Represent. X should be the number of the last (best) model you fitted, probably 2. Enter TIME as the Category Axis. In the simulation part of this course we have learned a very simple way to explore the dynamics of a system: The return plot. The time series is plotted against itself shifted by 1 step in time. Create return plots (use a Scatterplot) for the three time series. Tip: You can easily create a t+1 version of the time series by using the LAG function in a COMPUTE statement. For instance: COMPUTE TS_1_lag1 = LAG(TS_1) Are your conclusions about the time series the same as in 3. after interpreting these return plots? | jump to solution | "],

Figure 4.1: Definition of Heart Beat Periods. One HBI series is a sample from a male adult, 62 years old (called Jimmy). Approximately two years before the recording, the subject has had a coronary artery bypass, as advised by his physician following a diagnosis of congestive heart failure. Jimmy used antiarrhythmic medicines at the time of measurement. Another HBI series is a sample from a healthy male adult, 21 years old (called Tommy). This subject never reported any cardiac complaint. Tommy was playing the piano during the recording. A third supposed HBI series is fictitious, and was never recorded from a human subject (let’s call this counterfeit Dummy). Your challenge The assignment is to scrutinise the data and find out which time series belongs to Jimmy, Tommy, and Dummy respectively.2 4.3.2 First inspection The chances that you are an experienced cardiologist are slim. We therefore suggest you proceed your detective work as follows: Construct a graphical representation of the time series, and inspect their dynamics visually (use the code examples provided in the solutions to previous sessions to plot your time series). Write down your first guesses about which time series belongs to which subject. Take your time for this visual inspection (i.e., which one looks more like a line than a plane, which one looks more ‘smooth’ than ‘rough’). Next, explore some measures of central tendency and dispersion, etc. Third, compute the Relative Roughness for each time series, use Equation (4.1) \\[\\begin{equation} RR = 2\\left[1−\\frac{\\gamma_1(x_i)}{Var(x_i)}\\right] \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] The numerator in the formula stands for the lag 1 autocovariance of the HBI time series \\(x_i\\). The denominator stands for the (global) variance of \\(x_i\\). Most statistics packages can calculate these variances, R and Matlab have built in functions. Alternatively, you can create the formula yourself. Compare your (intuitive) visual inspection with these preliminary dynamic quantifications, and find out where each of the HIB series are positions on the ‘colorful spectrum of noises’ (i.e., line them up with Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2: Coloured Noise versus Relative Roughness 4.3.3 What do we know now, that we didn’t knew before? Any updates on Jimmy’s, Tommy’s and Dummy’s health? You may start to wonder about the ‘meaning’ of these dynamics, and not find immediate answers. Don’t worry; we’ll cover the interpretation over the next two weeks in further depth. Let’s focus the dynamics just a little further for now. It might give you some clues. Use the randperm function (in Matlab or in package pracma in R) to randomize the temporal ordering of the HBI series. Visualize the resulting time series to check whether they were randomized successfully Next estimate the Relative Roughness of the randomized series. Did the estimates change compared to your previous outcomes (if so, why)? Now suppose you would repeat what you did the previous, but instead of using shuffle you would integrate the fictitious HBI series (i.e., normalize, then use x=cumsum(x)). You can look up cumsum in R or Matlab’s Help documentation). Would you get an estimate of Relative Roughness that is approximately comparable with what you got in another HBI series? If so, why? | jump to solution | The HBI intervals were truncated (not rounded) to a multiple of 10 ms (e.g., an interval of 0.457s is represented as 0.450s), and to 750 data points each. The means and standard deviations among the HBI series are approximately equidistant, which might complicate your challenge.↩ "],

If you only have continuous data, you migh be better off using package nonlinearTseries, in this course we will only use package crqa. Package crqa() was designed to run categorical Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (see Coco &amp; Dale (2014) and for R code see appendices in Coco &amp; Dale (2013)). We can trick it to run auto-RQA by providing the same timeseries for ts1 and ts2 and setting the parameter side to either &quot;upper&quot; or &quot;lower&quot; Perform an RQA on the reconstructed state space of the Lorenz system. You’ll need a radius (also called: threshold) in order to decide which points are close together (recurrent). crqa provides a function which will automatically select the best parameter settings: optimizeParam() Best way to ensure you are using the same parameters in each function is to create some lists with parameter settings (check the crqa manual to figure out what these parameters mean): # General settings for `crqa()` par0 &lt;- list(rescale = 1, normalize = 0, mindiagline = 2, minvertline = 2, tw = 0, whiteline = FALSE, recpt = FALSE, side = &quot;lower&quot;, checkl = list(do = FALSE, thrshd = 3, datatype = &quot;categorical&quot;,pad = TRUE) ) # Settings for `optimizeParam()` par &lt;- list(lgM = 20, steps = seq(1, 6, 1), radiusspan = 100, radiussample = 40, normalize = par0$normalize, rescale = par0$rescale, mindiagline = par0$mindiagline, minvertline = par0$minvertline, tw = par0$tw, whiteline = par0$whiteline, recpt = par0$recpt, fnnpercent = 10, typeami = &quot;mindip&quot;) Get the optimal parameters using a radius which will give us 2%-5% recurrent points. ans &lt;- optimizeParam(ts1 = lx, ts2 = lx, par = par, min.rec = 2, max.rec = 5) Run the RQA analysis using the same settings with which the parameters were found. crqaOutput &lt;- crqa(ts1 = lx, ts2 = lx, delay = ans$delay, embed = ans$emddim, radius = ans$radius, normalize = par0$normalize, rescale = par0$rescale, mindiagline = par0$mindiagline, minvertline = par0$minvertline, tw = par0$tw, whiteline = par0$whiteline, recpt = par0$recpt, side = par0$side, checkl = par0$checkl ) The output of crqa is a list with recurrence measures, the last entry is the recurrence plot.

It is basically a list of indices of cells that contain a \\(1\\). The \\(0\\) do not need to be stored. In order to plot this matrix you could use image(), but this does not produce the recurrence plot as they are usually displayed, the y-axis needs to be flipped.

Assume the experiment tried to measure the effects of explicit predisposition and affective conditioning on attitudes towards Complexity Science measured in a sample of psychology students using a specially designed Implicit Attitude Test (IAT). Look at a Histogram of the difference score (post-pre) \\(dZY\\). This should look quite normal (pun intended). Perform a regular linear regression analysis predicting $dZY$ (Change in Attitude) from $\\alpha$ (Predisposition). Are you happy with the \\(R^2\\)? Look for Catastrophe Flags: Bimodality. Examine what the data look like if we split them across the conditions. Use \\(\\beta\\) (Conditioning) as a Split File Variable (Data &gt;&gt; Split File). And again, make a histogram of \\(dZY\\). Try to describe what you see in terms of the experiment. Turn Split File off. Make a Scatterplot of \\(dZY\\) (x-axis) and \\(\\alpha\\) (y-axis). Here you see the bimodality flag in a more dramatic fashion. Can you see another flag? Perhaps we should look at a cusp Catastrophe model: Go to Analyse &gt;&gt; Regression &gt;&gt; Nonlinear (also see Basic Time Series Analysis). First we need to tell SPSS which parameters we want to use, press Parameters. Now you can fill in the following: Intercept (Starting value \\(0.01\\)) B1 through B4 (Starting value \\(0.01\\)) Press Continue and use \\(dZY\\) as the dependent. Now we build the model in Model Expression, it should say this: Intercept + B1 * Beta * ZY1 + B2 * Alpha + B3 * ZY1 ** 2 + B4 * ZY1 ** 3 Run! And have a look at \\(R^2\\). The model can also be fitted with linear regression in SPSS, but we need to make some extra (nonlinear) variables using COMPUTE: BetaZY1 = Beta*ZY1 *(Bifurcation, splitting parameter). ZY1_2 = ZY1 ** 2 *(ZY1 Squared). ZY1_3 = ZY1 ** 3 *(ZY1 Cubed). Create a linear regression model with \\(dZY\\) as dependent and \\(Alpha\\), \\(BetaZY1\\) and \\(ZY1_2\\) en \\(ZY1_3\\) as predictors. Run! The parameter estimates should be the same.

["modeling-change-processes-in-1d.html", "Modeling change processes in 1D", " Modeling change processes in 1D The simplest non-trivial iterative change process can be described by the following difference equation: \\[\\begin{equation} Y_{t+1} = Y_{t=0} + a*Y_t \\tag{10.1} \\end{equation}\\] Equation (10.1) describes the way in which the value of \\(Y\\) changes between two adjacent, discrete moments in time (hence the term difference equation, or recurrence relation). There are two parameters resembling an intercept and a slope: The starting value \\(Y_0\\) at \\(t=0\\), also called the starting value, or the initial conditions. A rule for incrementing time, here the change in \\(Y\\) takes place over a discrete time step of 1: \\(t+1\\). The values taken on by variable \\(Y\\) are considered to represent the states quantifiable observable leAlternative ways to describe the change of states : A dynamical rule describing the propagation of the states of a system observable measured by the values of variable Y through discrete time. A dynamic law describing the time-evolution of the states of a system observable measured by the variable Y. These descriptions all refer to the change processes that govern system observables (properties of dynamical systems that can be observed through measurement). It’s a line! It’s a plane! The formula resembles the equation of a line. There is a constant value \\(Y_{0}\\) which is added to a proportion of the value of \\(Y\\) at time \\(t\\), given by parameter \\(a\\). This is equivalent to the slope of a line. However, in a \\((X,Y)\\) plane there are two ‘spatial’ (metric) dimensions representing the values two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) can take on (see figure). The best fitting straight line would be called a statistical model of the linear relationship between the observed values of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). It can be obtained by fitting a General Linear Model (GLM) to the data. If \\(X\\) were to represent repeated measurements the multivariate GLM for repeated measures would have to be fitted to the data. This can be very problematic, because statistical models rely on Ergodic theory: “… it is the study of the long term average behavior of systems evolving in time.”5 need to assume independence of measurements within and between subjects. These assumptions can be translated to certain conditions that must hold for the model to be valid, known as Compound Symmetry and Sphericity: The compound symmetry assumption requires that the variances (pooled within-group) and covariances (across subjects) of the different repeated measures are homogeneous (identical). This is a sufficient condition for the univariate F test for repeated measures to be valid (i.e., for the reported F values to actually follow the F distribution). However, it is not a necessary condition. The sphericity assumption is a necessary and sufficient condition for the F test to be valid; it states that the within-subject “model” consists of independent (orthogonal) components. The nature of these assumptions, and the effects of violations are usually not well-described in ANOVA textbooks;6 As you can read in the quoted text above, these conditions must hold in order to be able to identify unique independent components as the sources of variation of \\(Y\\) over time within a subject. This is the a clear example of: It is the theory that decides what we may observe7 If you choose to use GLM repeated measures to model change over time, you will only be able to infer independent components that are responsible for the time-evolution of \\(Y\\). As is hinted in the last sentence of the quote, the validity of such inferences is not a common topic of discussion statistics textbooks. No! … It’s a time series! The important difference between a regular 2-dimensional Euclidean plane and the space in which we model change processes is that the \\(X\\)-axis represents the physical dimension time. In the case of the Linear Map we have a 1D space with one ‘spatial’ dimension \\(Y\\) and a time dimension \\(t\\). This is called time series if \\(Y\\) is sampled as a continuous process, or a trial series if the time between subsequent observations is not relevant, just the fact that there was a temporal order (for example, a series of response latencies to trials in a psychological experiment in the order in which they were presented to the subject). Time behaves different from a spatial dimension in that it is directional (time cannot be reversed), it cannot take on negative values, and, unless one is dealing with a truly random process, there will be a temporal correlation across one or more values of \\(Y\\) seperated by an amount of time. In the linear difference equation this occurs because each value one step in the future is calculated based on the current value. If the values of \\(Y\\) represent an observable of a dynamical system, the system can be said to have a history, or a memory. Ergodic systems do not have a history or a memory that extends across more than one time step. This is very convenient, because one can calculate the expected value of a system observable given infinite time, by making use of of the laws of probabilities of random events (or random fields). This means: The average of an observable of an Ergodic system measured across infinite time (its entire history, the time-average), will be the be the same value as the average of this observable measured at one instance in time, but in an infinite amount of systems of the same kind (the population, the spatial average).8 The simple linear difference equation will have a form of *perfect memory’ across the smallest time scale (i.e., the increment of 1, \\(t+1\\)). This ‘memory’ concerns a correlation of 1 between values at adjacent time points (a short range temporal correlation, SRC), because the change from \\(Y_t\\) to \\(Y_{t+1}\\) is exactly equal to \\(a * Y_t\\) at each iteration step. This is the meaning of deterministic, not that each value of \\(Y\\) is the same, but that the value of \\(Y\\) now can be perfectly explained form the value of \\(Y\\) one moment in the past. Summarising, the most profound difference is not the fact that the equation of linear change is a deterministic model and the GLM is a probabilistic model with parameters fitted from data, this is something we can (and will) do for \\(a\\) as well. The profound difference between the models is the role given to the passage of time: The linear difference equation represents changes in \\(Y\\) as a function of the physical dimension time and \\(Y\\) itself. The GLM represents changes in \\(Y\\) as a function of a linear predictor composed of additive components that can be regarded as independent sources of variation that sum up to the observed values of \\(Y\\). --> See Dajani &amp; Dirksin (2008, p. 5, “A simple introduction to Ergodic Theory”)↩ Retreived from www.statsoft.com↩ Einstein as quoted by Heisenberg.↩ In other words: If you throw 1 die 100 times in a row, the average of the 100 numbers is the time-average of one of the observables of die-throwing systems. If this system is ergodic, then its time-average is expected to be similar to the average of the numbers that turn up if you throw 100 dice all at the same instance of time. The dice layed out on the table represent a spatial sample, a snapshot frozen in time, of the possible states the system can be in. Taking the average would be the spatial average this observable of die-throwing systems. This ergodic condiciotn is often implicitly assumed in Behavioural Science when studies claim to study change by taking different samples of individuals (snapshots of system states) and comparing if they are the same.↩ "],

["lecture-3.html", "Lecture 3", " Lecture 3 New to R? You have probably heard many people say they should invest more time and effort to learn to use the R software environment for statistical computing… and they were right. However, what they probably meant to say is: “I tried it, but it’s so damned complicated, I gave up”… and they were right. That is, they were right to note that this is not a point and click tool designed to accommodate any user. It was built for the niche market of scientists who use statistics, but in that segment it’s actually the most useful tool I have encountered so far. Now that your struggles with getting a grip on R are fully acknowledged in advance, let’s try to avoid the ‘giving up’ from happening. Try to follow these steps to get started: Get R and add some user comfort: Install the latest R software and install a user interface like RStudio… It’s all free! An R interface will make some things easier, e.g., searching and installing packages from repositories. RStudio will also add functionality, like git/svn version control, project management and more, like the tools to create html pages like this one (knitr and Rmarkdown). Another source of user comfort are the packages. R comes with some basic packages installed, but you’ll soon need to fit generalised linear mixture models, or visualise social networks using graph theory and that means you’ll be searching for packages that allow you to do such things. A good place to start package hunting are the CRAN task view pages. Learn by running example code: Copy the commands in the code blocks you find on this page, or any other tutorial or help files (e.g., Rob Kabacoff’s Quick R). Paste them into an .R script file in the script (or, source) editor. In RStudio You can run code by pressing cmd + enter when the cursor is on a single single line, or you can run multiple lines at once by selecting them first. If you get stuck remember that there are expert R users who probably have answered your question already when it was posted on a forum. Search for example through the Stackoverflow site for questions tagged with R) Examine what happens… when you tell R to make something happen: R stores variables (anything from numeric data to functions) in an Environment. There are in fact many different environments, but we’ll focus on the main workspace for the current R session. If you run the command x &lt;- 1+1, a variable x will appear in the Environment with the value 2 assigned to it. Examining what happens in the Environment is not the same as examining the output of a statistical analysis. Output in R will appear in the Console window. Note that in a basic set-up each new R session starts with an empty Environment. If you need data in another session, you can save the entire Environment, or just some selected variables, to a file (.RData). Learn about the properties of R objects: Think of objects as containers designed for specific content. One way to characterize the different objects in R is by how picky they are about the content you can assign it. There are objects that hold character and numeric type data, a matrix for numeric data organised in rows and columns, a data.frame is a matrix that allows different data types in columns, and least picky of all is the list object. It can carry any other object, you can have a list of which item 1 is an entire data.frame and item 2 is just a character vector of the letter R. The most difficult thing to master is how to efficiently work with these objects, how to assign values and query contents. Avoid repeating yourself: The R language has some amazing properties that allow execution of many repetitive algorithmic operations using just a few lines of code at speeds up to warp 10. Naturally, you’ll need to be at least half Vulcan to master these features properly and I catch myself copying code when I shouldn’t on a daily basis. The first thing you will struggle with are the apply functions. These functions pass the contents of a list object to a function. Suppose we need to calculate the means of column variables in 40 different SPSS .sav files stored in the folder DAT. With the foreign package loaded we can execute the following commands: data &lt;- lapply(dir(&quot;/DAT/&quot;,pattern=&quot;.sav$&quot;),read.spss) out &lt;- sapply(data,colMeans) The first command applies read.spss to all files with a .sav extension found in the folder /DAT. It creates a dataframe for each file which are all stored as elements of the list data. The second line applies the function colMeans to each element of data and puts the combined results in a matrix with dataset ID as columns (1-40), dataset variables as rows and the calculated column means as cells. This is just the beginning of the R magic, wait ’till you learn how to write functions that can create functions. "],

Solutions in R | jump to question | Coding the difference equations in Matlab and R is always easier than using a spreadsheet. One obvious way to do it is to use a counter variable representing the iterations of time in a for ... next loop. The iterations should run over a vector (which is the same concept as a row or a column in a spreadsheet: An indexed array of numbers or characters). The first entry should be the starting value, so the vector index \\(1\\) represents \\(Y_0\\). The loop can be implemented a number of ways, for example as a function which can be called from a script or the command / console window. In R working with functions is easy, and very much recommended, because it will speed up calculations considerably, and it will reduce the amount of code you need to write. You need to gain some experience with coding in R before you’ll get it right. In order to get it lean and clean (and possibly even mean as well) you’ll need a lot of experience with coding in R,therefore, we will (eventually) provide you the functions you’ll need to complete the assignments. All you have to do is figure out how to use, or modify them to suit your specific needs. To model the autocatalytic growth equations we provide a function growth.ac(), which is able to simulate all of the processes discussed in the lectures. Using just a few lines of code, each of the 4 difference equations used in the assignments can be simulated. Basically the code block below contains the solutions to the Linear Map, the stylized Logisitc Map and the Van Geert model for cognitive growth. growth.ac &lt;- function(Y0 = 0.01, r = 1, k = 1, N = 100, type = c(&quot;driving&quot;, &quot;damping&quot;, &quot;logistic&quot;, &quot;vanGeert&quot;)[1]){ # Create a vector Y of length N, which has value Y0 at Y[1] if(N&gt;1){ Y &lt;- as.numeric(c(Y0, rep(NA,N-2))) # Conditional on the value of type ... switch(type, # Iterate N steps of the difference function with values passed for Y0, k and r. driving = sapply(seq_along(Y), function(t) Y[[t+1]] &lt;&lt;- r * Y[t] ), damping = k + sapply(seq_along(Y), function(t) Y[[t+1]] &lt;&lt;- - r * Y[t]^2 / k), logistic = sapply(seq_along(Y), function(t) Y[[t+1]] &lt;&lt;- r * Y[t] * ((k - Y[t]) / k)), vanGeert = sapply(seq_along(Y), function(t) Y[[t+1]] &lt;&lt;- Y[t] * (1 + r - r * Y[t] / k)) )} return(ts(Y)) } # Call the function with default settings and r = 1.1 Y &lt;- growth.ac(r = 1.1) Some notes about this function: To select which growth process to simulate, the argument type is defined which takes the values driving (default), damping, logistic and vanGeert. The statement switch(type, ...) will iterate an equation based on the value of type. A time series object is returned due to the function ts(). This is a convenient way to represent time series data, it can also store the sample rate of the signal and start and end times. Most of the basic functions, like plot() and summary() will recognise a time series object when it is passed as an argument and use settings appropriate for time series data. The sapply() function iterates \\(t\\) from \\(1\\) to the number of elements in \\(Y\\) (seq_along(Y)) and then applies the function. The double headed arrow &lt;&lt;- is necessary because we want to update vector \\(Y\\), which is defined outside the sapply() environment. The time series object The time series object is expected to have a time-dimension on the x-axis. This is very convenient, because R will generate the time axis for you by looking at the time series properties attribute of the object. Even though we are not working with measurement ourcomes, consider a value at a time-index in a time series object a sample: Start - The value of time at the first sample in the series (e.g., \\(0\\), or \\(1905\\)) End - The value of time at the last sample in the series (e.g., \\(100\\), or \\(2005\\)) Frequency - The amount of time that passed between two samples, or, the sample rate (e.g., \\(0.5\\), or \\(10\\)) Examples of using the time series object. # Get sample rate info tsp(Y) [1] 1 100 1 # Extract the time vector time(Y) Time Series: Start = 1 End = 100 Frequency = 1 [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 [18] 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 [35] 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 [52] 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 [69] 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 [86] 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 For now, these values are in principle all arbitrary units (a.u.). These settings only make sense if they represent the parameters of an actual measurement procedure. It is easy to adjust the time vector, by assigning new values using tsp() (values have to be possible given the timeseries length). For example, suppose the sampling frequency was \\(0.1\\) instead of \\(1\\) and the Start time was \\(10\\) and End time was \\(1000\\). # Assign new values tsp(Y) &lt;- c(10, 1000, .1) # Time axis is automatically adjusted time(Y) Time Series: Start = 10 End = 1000 Frequency = 0.1 [1] 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 [15] 150 160 170 180 190 200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 [29] 290 300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390 400 410 420 [43] 430 440 450 460 470 480 490 500 510 520 530 540 550 560 [57] 570 580 590 600 610 620 630 640 650 660 670 680 690 700 [71] 710 720 730 740 750 760 770 780 790 800 810 820 830 840 [85] 850 860 870 880 890 900 910 920 930 940 950 960 970 980 [99] 990 1000 Plotting a ts object as a time series Depending on which packages you use, there will be different settings applied to time series objects created by ts(). Below are some examples of differences between plotting routines. require(lattice) # Needed for plotting require(latticeExtra) # Needed for plotting # stats::plot.ts plot(growth.ac(r = -.9), lwd = 2, main = &quot;stats::plot.ts&quot;) # lattice::xyplot.ts xyplot(growth.ac(r = -.9), lwd = 2, main = &quot;lattice::xyplot.ts&quot;) Plotting multiple time series in one figure Plot multiple timeseries in frames with plot.ts() in package::stats. This function takes a matrix as input, here we use cbind( ... ). # stats::plot.ts plot(cbind(growth.ac(r = 0.9), growth.ac(r = 1.0), growth.ac(r = -0.8) ), yax.flip = TRUE, ann = FALSE, col = &quot;blue&quot;, frame.plot = TRUE) title(main = expression(paste(&quot;Unrestricted Growth: &quot;,Y[t+1]==r*Y[t])), ylab = &quot;| r = -0.8 | r = 1 | r = 0.9 |&quot;, xlab = &quot;time (a.u.)&quot;) Plot multiple timeseries in one graph with ts.plot() in package::graphics. This function can handle multiple ts objects as arguments. # graphics::ts.plot ts.plot(growth.ac(r = 0.9), growth.ac(r = 1), growth.ac(r = -.8), gpars = list(xlab = &quot;time (a.u.)&quot;, ylab = expression(Y(t)), main = expression(paste(&quot;Unrestricted Growth: &quot;,Y[t+1]==r*Y[t])), lwd = rep(2,3), lty = c(1:3), col = c(&quot;darkred&quot;,&quot;darkblue&quot;,&quot;darkgreen&quot;) ) ) legend(70, -0.015, c(&quot;r = 0.9&quot;,&quot;r = 1.0&quot;, &quot;r = -0.8&quot;), lwd = rep(2,3), lty = c(1:3), col = c(&quot;darkred&quot;,&quot;darkblue&quot;,&quot;darkgreen&quot;), merge = TRUE) Use xyplot() in package::lattice to create a plot with panels. The easiest way to do this is to create a dataset in so-called “long” format. This means the variable to plot is in 1 column and other variables indicate different levels, or conditions under which the variable was observed or simulated. Function ldply() is used to generate \\(Y\\) for three different settings of \\(r\\). The values of \\(r\\) are passed as a list and after a function is applied the result is returned as a dataframe. require(plyr) # Needed for function ldply() # Create a long format dataframe for various values for `r` data &lt;- ldply(c(0.9,1,-0.8), function(r) cbind.data.frame(Y = as.numeric(growth.ac(r = r)), time = as.numeric(time(growth.ac(r = r))), r = paste0(&quot;r = &quot;, r))) # Plot using the formula interface xyplot(Y ~ time | r, data = data, type = &quot;l&quot;, main = expression(paste(&quot;Unrestricted Growth: &quot;,Y[t+1]==r*Y[t]))) One can also have different panels represent different growth functions. # Create a long format dataframe for combinations of `type` and `r` param &lt;- list(driving = 1.1, damping = 0.9, logistic = 2.9, vanGeert = 1.9) # Use the `names()` function to pass the `type` string as an argument. data &lt;- ldply(seq_along(param), function(p){ cbind.data.frame(Y = as.numeric(growth.ac(r = param[[p]], type = names(param[p]))), time = as.numeric(time(growth.ac(r = param[[p]], type = names(param[p])))), type = paste0(names(param[p]), &quot; | r = &quot;, param[p])) }) # Plot using the formula interface xyplot(Y ~ time | factor(type), data = data, type = &quot;l&quot;, scales = c(relation = &quot;free&quot;), main = &quot;Four Autocatalytic Growth Models&quot;) The return plot To create a return plot the values of \\(Y\\) have to be shifted by a certain lag. The functions lead() and lag() in package::dplyr are excellent for this purpose (note that dplyr::lag() behaves different from stats::lag()). # Function lag() and lead() require(dplyr) # Get exponential growth Y1 &lt;- growth.ac(Y0 = .9, r = .9, N = 1000, type = &quot;driving&quot;) # Get logistic growth in the chaotic regime Y2 &lt;- growth.ac(r = 4, N = 1000, type = &quot;logistic&quot;) # Use the `lag` function from package `dplyr` op &lt;- par(mfrow = c(1,2), pty = &quot;s&quot;) plot(lag(Y1), Y1, xy.labels = FALSE, pch = &quot;.&quot;, xlim = c(0,1), ylim = c(0,1), xlab = &quot;Y(t)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Y(t+1)&quot;, main = expression(paste(Y[t+1]==r*Y[t]))) plot(lag(Y2), Y2, xy.labels = FALSE, pch = &quot;.&quot;, xlim = c(0,1), ylim = c(0,1), xlab = &quot;Y(t)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Y(t+1)&quot;, main = expression(paste(Y[t+1]==r*Y[t]*(1-Y[t])))) par(op) Use l_ply() from package::plyr to create return plots with different lags. The l_ before ply means the function will take a list as input to a function, but it will not expect any data to be returned, for example in the case of a function that is used to plot something. # Explore different lags op &lt;- par(mfrow = c(1,2), pty = &quot;s&quot;) l_ply(1:4, function(l) plot(lag(Y2, n = l), Y2, xy.labels = FALSE, pch = &quot;.&quot;, xlim = c(0,1), ylim = c(0,1), xlab = &quot;Y(t)&quot;, ylab = paste0(&quot;Y(t+&quot;,l,&quot;)&quot;), cex = .8)) par(op) Solutions in Matlab. For Matlab we provide an example of a simple for ... next loop, which should be easy to translate to R if you want to.

An example is the predator-prey system discussed in the next assignment. Using the ‘conditional’ rules on a number of seperate processes will ‘work’ as a model, but it isn’t exactly what is meant by interaction dynamics, or multiplicative interactions.

["using-r-to-fit-the-solutions.html", "C.3 Using R to fit the solutions", " C.3 Using R to fit the solutions There are several packages that can perform nonlinear regression analysis, the function most resembling the approach used by SPSS is nls in the default stats package.

This means, “do not use it on data generated by a deterministic model which has no residual error”, which is exactly what the timeseries in this assignment is, it is the output of the quadratic map in the chaotic regime.

["psdsol.html", "D.1 Assignment: The Spectral Slope", " D.1 Assignment: The Spectral Slope | jump to assignment | First, load the data and source the function library. Example of using --ply functions Let’s try to use as few commands as possible to analyse all three timeseries. The easiest way to do this is to use the so-called apply family of functions. These functions pass the contents of a list object to a function. Suppose we need to calculate the means of column variables in 40 different SPSS .sav files stored in the folder DAT. With the rio package loaded we can execute the following commands: data &lt;- lapply(dir(&quot;/DAT/&quot;,pattern=&quot;.sav$&quot;),import) out &lt;- sapply(data,colMeans) The first command applies import to all files with a .sav extension found in the folder /DAT. It creates a dataframe for each file which are all stored as elements of the list object data. The second line applies the function colMeans to each element of data and puts the combined results in a matrix with the dataset ID as columns (1-40), dataset variables as rows and the calculated column means as cells. R comes with several apply functions installed, but an easier interface is provided by package plyr. When plyr is loaded you can use functions of the type XYply where X denotes the first letter of the input structure and Y the ouput structure: l for list, d for 'data.frame, a for array. So, laply() expects a listobject as input and will try to create an array as outout. There is also a special symbol for Y, the underscore _ if no output is expected, e.g. when plotting, l_ply. Data preparation Let’s prepare these series for spectral analysis. library(plyr) TSlist &lt;- list(TS1=TS1$TS1,TS2=TS2$TS2,TS3=TS3$TS3) # Plot raw l_ply(TSlist, plot.ts) # Normalise TSlist.n &lt;- llply(TSlist,scale) # Plot normalised l_ply(TSlist.n, plot.ts) # Detrend TSlist.nd &lt;- llply(TSlist.n, detrend) # Plot normalised, detrended l_ply(TSlist.nd, plot.ts) Time-series length Another preparation concerns checking wether the length of the series is a power of 2 (or 10). This is necessary for the Fourier transfrom to run smoothly. The code below uses log2 and nextpow2 to figure out whether the data length is ok. What is different from previous uses of the XYply functions is that we now customise the function we want to execute. The input is still a list object, each element of the list is passed as a variable ts to a so-called anonymous function, a function just denoted as function(ts). The function returns a data.frame with columns pow2, the current power of 2 and nextpow2 (a function of pracma) the next power of 2. The XYply functions will add an .id variable to the output if the input is a list with named fields. Although we create 3 data frames of one row, the d in ldply indicates these frames have to be merged if possible. ldply(TSlist.nd, function(ts) data.frame(pow2 = log2(length(ts)), nextpow2 = nextpow2(length(ts)))) .id pow2 nextpow2 1 TS1 11 11 2 TS2 11 11 3 TS3 11 11 In this case we don’t have to take any action, \\(2048\\) is a power of 2. Actions that could be taken are: removing datapoints from the front of the series, or, padding the series with zeroes. The fd.psd function The function created for spectral analysis fd.psd() will perform normalisation and detrending by default. It also returns information about the power spectrum and log-log fit. It’s good to know about the default settings of a function, and the return values. The best place to look for them is usually the help documentation, or the vignettes that come with a package. If you select a function in Rstudio and press F1 you’ll get the help page, If you press F2 can have a look at the code (if it is exported), or, you can call the function without parentheses fd.psd and the code will be printed to the Console. You can also hover the cursor after you typed the name of the function to reveal the arguments and defaults: Figure D.1: Get default values of function arguments. Another way to get this info is to use the function formals() formals(fd.psd) $y $fs NULL $normalize [1] TRUE $dtrend [1] TRUE $plot [1] FALSE Now we know this function has arguments normalize and dtrend set to TRUE, and plot set to FALSE. We could feed the fuction the raw data, or feed it our normalised, detrended, data and change the defaults. In the XYply functions, you can just add function arguments after the function name. # Analyse outPSD &lt;- llply(TSlist.nd, fd.psd, normalize = FALSE, dtrend = FALSE, plot=TRUE) fd.psd: Sample rate was set to 1. fd.psd: Sample rate was set to 1. fd.psd: Sample rate was set to 1. -->"],
